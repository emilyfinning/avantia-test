## Instructions

To run the app use `npm run dev`

The app will be accessible at localhost:3000 unless the port is already in use.

## Notes

I chose to do this test using Next.js as it comes pre-packaged with a setup for a public API. My strengths lie more in the Front-End and this was quicker than trying to setup a separate server.

On scraping I have no familiarity with any scraping libraries or tools nor with parsing HTML, so my solution is very simple and therefore not very accurate.
If we were looking for accuracy here in labelling an article we would be looking at ML solutions that I did not have time to implement here (though I did cover this sort of analysis in my dissertation).

Front-End wise I've tried to keep it as simple as possible with a search bar, an indicator of the result of the scraping and a display of the 'evidence' I've found to support the claim. While nothing flashy I do think it presents the data well enough for this purpose. There is definitely work to be done accessibility wise here.
